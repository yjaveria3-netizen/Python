- Example: `@staticmethod`, `@property`

### Q: What is the GIL (Global Interpreter Lock)?
**A:** GIL explained:
- Allows only one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time
- Affects CPU-bound multi-threading performance
- Doesn't affect I/O-bound operations
- Solutions: multiprocessing, async programming

### Q: What are Python generators?
**A:** Generators are special functions:
